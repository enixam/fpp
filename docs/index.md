# Preface {-}

This project contains my learning notes and code for [*Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd edition*](https://otexts.com/fpp3/). My solutions to its exercises can be found at https://qiushi.rbind.io/fpp-exercises

Other references include:   

- [*Applied Time Series Analysis for Fisheries and Environmental Sciences*](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa-labs/)

- a video tutorial on time series concepts presented in this [youtube watchlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvcbYUQ5t0UHOLnBzl46_Q6QKtFgfMGc3) by [ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUcpVoi5KkJmnE3bvEhHR0Q)

- an [online course](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510) offered by the Department of Statistics at PennState   

My contributions include  

- More supplementary mathematical proofs: they are not hard assuming introductory level statistics knowledge, but skimmed in the book

- An additional chapter separating basic concepts of univariate processes from ARIMA models, so that Chapter \@ref(arima-models) will not be too verbose  

- Up-to-date `tidyverse` code: for example `gather()` use cases are changed into `pivot_longer()`

I will continue to add new topics as I learn new things related to time series modelling. 

`tidyverse` is assumed to be loaded before each chapter.
